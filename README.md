## Getting Started

journals-frontend runs in it's own docker container, but relies on [`Journals Service`](https://github.com/edx/journals/blob/master/README.rst) and [`edx platform`](https://github.com/edx/devstack/blob/master/README.rst) containers to be running to be fully functional.

Please follow [`these instructions`](https://github.com/edx/journals/blob/master/README.rst#getting-started) to setup the journals-frontend and prerequiste containers.

This container can be started by running `make up` and can be accessed via http://localhost:1991 after it's running.
